						<p>CivicTechWR brings together people from different sectors and industries to actively solve issues facing our local community. We welcome people with all types and levels of skills. Even though "tech" is in the name, everyone is welcome and everyone has a skill or experience that is valuable. You don’t need to know anything about the local government either, even though “civic” is in the name.</p>
						<p>If you have a project idea, announcement, or event, you’re welcome to pitch at any of our hacknights, or join our <a href="{{ site.slack_invite }}">slack team</a> to talk to the group.</p>

							<p>We generally have between 10-20 attendees for our speaker nights. If you’re willing to provide a light dinner for our members, that’s even better, but not necessary!</p>
