						<h2 class="intro-heading">The Civic Tech Movement</h2>
						<p>Civic Tech Waterloo Region was founded in July 2017. We were inspired by similar organizations like CivicTechTO, Beta City YEG, and Code for America Brigades.</p>
						<p>We are part of a larger civic tech movement, with groups like ours self-organizing across Canada. Below you can explore the other communities in the civic tech network.</p>

						<h2 class="intro-heading">How it works</h2>
						<p>We get together every two weeks for "hacknights" where we work various projects that combine design and technology for the public good. Anyone can pitch a project idea to the group to seek out collaborators and support. Every second hacknight we have a guest speaker who talks about a project or initiative they are working on.</p>
						<p>We welcome participants from all backgrounds and skill levels - you don't have to be a techie to join! If you're interested in design, technology, policy, activism, community development, problem solving, or local politics, this is the place for you.</p>
